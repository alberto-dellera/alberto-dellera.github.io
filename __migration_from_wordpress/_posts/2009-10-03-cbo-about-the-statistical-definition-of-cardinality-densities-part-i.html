<p>Let's explore the concept of cardinality from the point of view of the statistician; this is both to get a clearer vision of the matter (i.e. for fun) and to path the way for understanding the rationale for the "density" statistics as calculated by dbms_stats (the topic of an upcoming post).</p>
<p>Let's consider a statement with input parameters (bind variables), and consider the most fundamental of them all, the one with a filter predicate:<br />
[sql]<br />
select ...<br />
  from t<br />
 where x = :x;<br />
[/sql]<br />
the cardinality "card" of the set of rows retrieved depends on the table possible values and the actual inputs provided by the client as bind variable values. What about the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_value">expected value</a> E[card] ?<br />
Let:<br />
1) w(:x) ("w" stands for "workload") the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_mass_function">probability mass function</a> of the random variable :x (that completely characterizes the workload);<br />
2) E[count(:x)] the expected value of the cardinality of the rows retrieved for each value of :x.</p>
<p>We have, assuming that the two are independent:<br />
[text]<br />
E[card] = sum ( w(:x) * E[count(:x)] )<br />
for all values of :x<br />
[/text]</p>
<p>To solve the formula we have to know (or assume) the client-dictated w(:x). The same goes for the table <a href=" http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_population">potential population</a> (that -together with the statement of course- shapes E[count(:x)]); we must either have some statistical measurements about the table (for example, a frequency histogram on column X that we consider representative of the table population) or assume them (for example, assume a certain distribution for the column X values).</p>
<p>It is interesting to explore the most used scenario: a uniform (or assumed uniform) distribution for the column X values, of which we know the number of distinct values num_distinct(X) and the total number of values num_rows (let them be deterministically known for simplicity, and exclude null values). That means that E[count(:x)]) is equal to num_rows / num_distinct(X) <i>over a finite set that contains num_distinct(X) values</i> and is equal to zero over the remaining ones. </p>
<p>It is relatively easy to see that E[card] depends on how w(:x) and E[count(:x)]) overlap. At one end of the spectrum, if the client always submits values for :x that are not contained in the table, E[card] is zero - since the client choice matematically translates into E[count(:x)]) being zero over all values of :x for which w(:x) is non zero. At the other end of the spectrum, that is, under the <a href="http://www.adellera.it/blog/2009/09/03/cbo-the-non-empty-result-set-assumption/">non empty result set assumption</a>, we have E[card] = sum ( w(:x) ) * num_rows / num_distinct(X) = num_rows / num_distinct(X), the usual formula used by the CBO in many (most) situations. </p>
<p>The "density" column statistic formula can be derived in a similar way, but using a different assumption about w(:x) - as we will see in a dedicated post.</p>
