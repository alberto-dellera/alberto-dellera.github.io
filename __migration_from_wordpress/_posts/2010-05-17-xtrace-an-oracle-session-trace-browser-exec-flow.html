excerpt: Tracing a session is extremely useful when you need to investigate how  a
  client interacts with the database - the client could be an application of yours,
  a third-party application, or an Oracle module such as dbms_stats or dbms_mview.  To
  get the perfect picture of the client-server dialogue,  you "simply" need to consider
  all EXEC lines in the trace file, and associate to each line the executed statement
  and the bind variable values; a very tedious and error-prone task  when done manually,
  that Xtrace  can make for you (and for free).

<p>Tracing a session is extremely useful when you need to investigate how  a client interacts with the database - the client could be an application of yours, a third-party application, or an Oracle module such as dbms_stats or dbms_mview.  To get the perfect picture of the client-server dialogue,  you "simply" need to consider all EXEC lines in the trace file, and associate to each line the executed statement and the bind variable values; a very tedious and error-prone task  when done manually, that <a href="http://www.adellera.it/xtrace">Xtrace</a>  can make for you (and for free).</p>
<p>Let's see the tool in action. Consider tracing a call to this stored procedure, that executes a recursive SQL statement :<br />
[sql]<br />
create or replace procedure test_proc( p_x int )<br />
is<br />
begin<br />
  for i in 1..p_x loop<br />
    for k in (select count(*) from t where x &gt; i) loop<br />
      null;<br />
    end loop;<br />
  end loop;<br />
end;<br />
[/sql]<br />
Here  is the output of Xtrace:<br />
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/2010/05/xtrace_exec_flow_11_2_0_1_lines_no_binds.gif" /><br />
Reading it bottom-up, you can see that the client called the SP, which in turn executed recursively (note the indentation) the SQL statement twice.  </p>
<p>You can also ask Xtrace to display the bind variable values used for each execution:<br />
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/2010/05/xtrace_exec_flow_11_2_0_1_lines_with_binds.gif" /><br />
So - the client passed the value "2" for :p_x to the SP, which in turn executed the SQL statement first passing  "1" for :B1,  and  then passing "2". </p>
<p>Interested ? Try it live  (requires Java Web Start):<br />
<script type="text/javascript" src="http://www.java.com/js/deployJava.js"></script><br />
<script type="text/javascript"><br />
        // you can enable tracing using the "Java Control Panel"; in Windows is inside the "Control Panel"<br />
        // check "http://www.java.com/js/deployJava.txt" for code of deployJava.js<br />
        // using JavaScript to get location of JNLP file relative to HTML page<br />
        var dir = location.href.substring(0, location.href.lastIndexOf('/')+1);<br />
        var url =  "http://www.adellera.it/xtrace/dist/xtrace_exec_flow_11_2_0_1.jnlp";<br />
        // following requires Java SE 6 update 18, downloads it automatically<br />
        // minimumVersion is of the form #[.#[.#[_#]]]<br />
        //deployJava.createWebStartLaunchButtonEx(url, '1.6.0_18'); DOES NOT WORK starting from 6u19<br />
        deployJava.createWebStartLaunchButton(url);<br />
</script><br />
When Xtrace opens up, press the "options" button and then the "EXEC FLOW analysis" button.  Enable/disable the bind variable values using the "display BINDS under EXEC" checkbox; color the statements as you like.</p>
<p>We introduced Xtrace in <a href="http://www.adellera.it/blog/2010/04/08/xtrace-an-oracle-session-trace-browser-introduction/">this post</a>; the <a href="http://www.adellera.it/xtrace">Xtrace home page</a> contains the tool (which can be used online or downloaded) - and a manual for advanced uses.</p>
