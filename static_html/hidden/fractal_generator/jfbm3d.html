<h3>
The (an)isotropic stocastic fractals</h3>
These are the stocastic processes that&nbsp; I studied and developed in
my Thesis.
<br>Aren't they wonderful ? Sure they are! And so, when one wants to practice
a bit of Java, there's nothing better than build an image generator that
reveals them ...
<br>How does it work ? Basically by constructing a realization of their
spectrum and applying the inverse FFT (fast Fourier transform). I've simplified
the algorithm since I didn't want to spend too much time translating from
C++ to Java, but the result is nearly the same.
<p>Here they are (the scrollbar on the right sets the Fractal Dimension:
the more "ruvid" the image, the higher the fractal dimension).
<p>Note: <b>this applet may not work in your browser. </b>JVM used by browsers
are notoriously eccentric in their behaviour, and of course I can't pretend
to have built an industrial-strength application...
