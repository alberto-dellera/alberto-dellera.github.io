<p>I've finally managed to implement an install-free version of my utility to check for bind variables usage. The new script is named bvc_check.sql and when run, it examines the SQL statements stored in the library cache (through gv$sql) and dumps the ones that would be the same if the literals were replaced by bind variables. </p>
<p>An example of the output:<br />
[text]<br />
------------------<br />
statements count :  0000000003<br />
bound    : select*from t where x=:n<br />
example 1: select * from t where x = 2<br />
example 2: select * from t where x = 3<br />
------------------<br />
[/text]<br />
So we have 3 statements that are the same once literals are replaced with bind variables. Two examples are provided; the action of replacing the literals 2 and 3 with the bind variable :n makes the statements the same.</p>
<p>The script are available on <a href="http://www.adellera.it/scripts_etcetera/bvc/index.html">this page</a>, that also explains the script workings in more detail and describes other scripts that might be of interest.</p>
