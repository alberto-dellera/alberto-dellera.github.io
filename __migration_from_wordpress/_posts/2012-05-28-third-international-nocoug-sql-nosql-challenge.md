For anyone into using their SQL skills creatively, and getting out of the boring SQL-coding daily routine ... here is a puzzle that is both entertaining and challenging, and with a real prize for the winner!

Official abstract:  
"In [this challenge](http://bit.ly/JvJS46) (see page 25), the Wicked Witch of the West needs help in creating a magic spell to ensure that the Third Annual Witching & Wizarding Ball is a grand success. The winner will receive the August Order of the Wooden Pretzel in keeping with the Steven Feuerstein’s observation that "some people can perform seeming miracles with straight SQL, but the statements end up looking like pretzels created by somebody who is experimenting with hallucinogens." There are currently four knights of the August Order of the Wooden Pretzel: Alberto Dell’Era (Italy) who won the [first challenge](http://bit.ly/heUb1T) in 2009 and Andre Araujo (Australia), Rob van Wijk (Netherlands), and Ilya Chuhnakov (Russia) who won the [second challenge](http://bit.ly/NoCOUG-SQL-Challenge-2) in 2011."

I remember having a lot of fun when I joined the first edition of this Challenge - I hope the same for you :)
