<title>Alberto Dell'Era: Range predicates selectivity</title>
<!--#include virtual="/ssi_post_title.html" -->
<br>
<br>An <a href="range_sel_index.html">investigation</a>, based on Jonathan Lewis' test case "Discrete Dangers" on page 126 of "<a href="http://www.jlcomp.demon.co.uk/cbo_book/ind_book.html#addenda">Cost Based Oracle</a>", to discover and illustrate the exact formula that the CBO uses to estimate the cardinality for (bounded) range predicates.
<br>
<br>The main result is that Jonathan's "standard formula" applies in a wider context than expected (by me at least), allowing for a couple of slight modifications relevant for some (but important) cases only.
