<p>Mainly because I like to write, and people usually like my writings. So, why not ?</p>
<p>Also - because it is a good way of learning. When I was a student, I remember that my favorite reharsal technique was to pretend I was explaining the topic to an imaginary person that knew nothing about it - and that technique worked very well, because when explaining, I very frequently discovered flaws in my knowledge that prompted me to improve even more. Blogging has the same advantage - with the additional bonus that the readers are real, hence they will discover (and hopefully tell me) much more flaws than my good old imaginary friend. A flaw discovered today is an error avoided in production tomorrow.</p>
<p>Then there's interaction with others, that will for sure provide me with interesting insights and other topics to investigate, or even a full-blown discussion extending across posts, blog pages and even ... restaurant tables.</p>
<p>So, here I am. Hope that you will find this Oracle blog useful ...</p>
