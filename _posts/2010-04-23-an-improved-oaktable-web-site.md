Today the new OakTable web site, [www.oaktable.net](http://www.oaktable.net), has been published: many thanks to [Kurt Van Meerbeeck](http://www.ora600.be/) (that I'm told worked the most on the site), [James Morle](http://jamesmorle.wordpress.com/) and [Marco Gralike](http://www.liberidu.com/blog/)!

I really like (besides the light and modern look) the aggregator of the OakTable members' blogs - a window on high-quality news and investigations about Oracle ...
