<p>Just a short note to tell my friends that I have been bestowed the <i>August Order of the Wooden Pretzel</i>, that is, that I won the NoCOUG's "First international SQL challenge" with <a href=" http://www.adellera.it/investigations/nocoug_challenge/index.html">this solution</a>. </p>
<p>I'm especially happy to see that, after (way too) many years since graduation, I am still able to use my math skills to solve problems ... :). </p>
<p>Many thanks to <a href="http://iggyfernandez.wordpress.com/ ">Iggy Fernandez</a> for setting up the contest (and running it with love and dedication), <a href="http://www.singingsql.com">Dan Tow</a> for judging the solution and of course <a href=" http://prodlife.wordpress.com/">Chen Shapira</a> for advertising and "supporting" it on her blog!</p>
