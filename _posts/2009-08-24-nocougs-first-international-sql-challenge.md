Just a short note to tell my friends that I have been bestowed the _August Order of the Wooden Pretzel_, that is, that I won the NoCOUG's "First international SQL challenge" with [this solution](/static_html/investigations/nocoug_challenge/index.html).

I'm especially happy to see that, after (way too) many years since graduation, I am still able to use my math skills to solve problems ... :).

Many thanks to [Iggy Fernandez](http://iggyfernandez.wordpress.com/ ) for setting up the contest (and running it with love and dedication), [Dan Tow](http://www.singingsql.com) for judging the solution and of course [Chen Shapira](http://prodlife.wordpress.com/) for advertising and "supporting" it on her blog!
