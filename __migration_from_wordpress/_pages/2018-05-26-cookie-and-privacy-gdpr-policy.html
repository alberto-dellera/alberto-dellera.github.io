<p><strong>Cookie and Privacy (GDPR-like) Policy</strong></p>
<p>This site is strictly personal and not linked to any business organization, hence I'm not legally bounded to the GDPR regulation.</p>
<p>Anyway, I adhere to the spirit of GDPR, hence:</p>
<ul>
<li>I do not sell or communicate any personal data to anyone, except Google Analytics (see below)</li>
<li>the only personal data I collect are the ones that the user may wish to communicate in comments (name, email, website), plus the IP address that is collected automatically</li>
<li>the software (Wordpress and its plugins) are always kept up-to-date to prevent data breaches as much as possible</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want your data to be removed, or have any question, just drop me an email to alberto.dellera@gmail.com</p>
<p><strong>Google Analytics:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Google Analytics gets only the IP, I do not send any additional "personal" infos about users</li>
<li>I do not even use the "Advertising" features - I actually use Analytics just out of curiosity sometimes, to see aggregated data (country, language) about my readers</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cookies Specific:</strong></p>
<p>This site uses cookies - small text files that are placed on your machine to help the site provide a better user experience. In general, cookies are used to retain user preferences, store information for things like shopping carts, and provide anonymised tracking data to third party applications like Google Analytics. As a rule, cookies will make your browsing experience better. However, you may prefer to disable cookies on this site and on others. The most effective way to do this is to disable cookies in your browser. We suggest consulting the Help section of your browser or taking a look at <a href="http://www.aboutcookies.org">the About Cookies website</a> which offers guidance for all modern browsers</p>
