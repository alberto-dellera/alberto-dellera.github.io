<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-841" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/2009/04/faccione.jpeg" alt="" width="128" height="128" /> I've spent all my professional life working within the Italian Telecommunications sector since 1996, specializing in the Oracle database full-time since 1999. I currently work for a big (2600+ employees) consultancy firm as an Oracle specialist, very often optimizing customers' systems ("Performance Tuning"), and developing for the flagship customer Web portal of one of the largest Italian mobile operators. I also hold a Math-oriented degree in Electronics Engineering from the "Politecnico di Milano" University.</p>
<p>I am honoured of being a member of <a href="http://www.oaktable.net">OakTable Network</a>, the famous organization of Oracle professionals distinguished by the use of the Scientific Method (and related ethics) for all their activities.</p>
<p>I currently live in Milano (Northern Italy).</p>
<p>I welcome any comment, feedback, correction and question.</p>
