<p>Today the new OakTable web site, <a href="http://www.oaktable.net">www.oaktable.net</a>, has been published: many thanks to <a href="http://www.ora600.be/">Kurt Van Meerbeeck</a> (that I'm told worked the most on the site), <a href="http://jamesmorle.wordpress.com/">James Morle</a> and <a href="http://www.liberidu.com/blog/">Marco Gralike</a>!</p>
<p>I really like (besides the light and modern look) the aggregator of the OakTable members' blogs - a window on high-quality news and investigations about Oracle ...</p>
