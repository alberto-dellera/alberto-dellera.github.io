<p>As a minor but useful new feature, <a href="http://www.adellera.it/scripts_etcetera/xplan/index.html">xplan</a> is now able to integrate into its report the DDL of tables (and indexes) referenced by the plan, calling dbms_metadata.get_ddl transparently. </p>
<p>This is mostly useful to get more details about referenced tables' constraints and partitions definition - to complement their CBO-related statistics that xplan reports about.</p>
<p>This feature can be activated by specifing dbms_metadata=y or dbms_metadata=all (check xplan.sql header of xplan.sql for more informations).</p>
<p>We spoke about xplan in general <a href="http://www.adellera.it/blog/2009/08/07/xplan-/">here</a>.</p>
