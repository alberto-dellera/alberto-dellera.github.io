<title>Alberto Dell'Era: Select Without Replacement</title>
<!--#include virtual="/ssi_post_title.html" -->
<br>
<br>This <a href="SelectWithoutReplacement.pdf">paper</a> shows how the Oracle&trade; Cost Based Optimizer uses pervasively
<br>a fundamental statistical formula for cardinality estimation of distinct, group-by and join operations.
<br>
<br>The formula gives the expected number of distinct values when selecting from a bag without replacement;
<br>the paper illustrates the use of this formula when the selection is made from tables instead of bags
<br>as a consequence of using filtering predicates in SQL statements.
<br>
<br>Both single-column and multiple-columns scenarios are illustrated.
<br>
<br>Particular emphasys is placed on the multi-column join operation, that implements additional statistical
<br>concepts to estimate the cardinality. The traditional algorithm is investigated, and also the new algorithm 
<br>introduced in 10g (and backported to the latest patchsets of 9i) commonly known as "10g multicolumn join selectivity sanity check".
