</head><body>
<br><b>Conclusion</b>
<br>
<br>Starting from Jonathan Lewis' test case "Discrete Dangers" on page 126 of his book "<a href="http://www.jlcomp.demon.co.uk/cbo_book/ind_book.html#addenda">Cost Based Oracle</a>", 
<br>we have investigated (and illustrated with graphs) the CBO cardinality estimation algorithm for range-based predicates:
<pre>
  select x from t where x >  low_x and x <  high_x  (open  , open  )
  select x from t where x >= low_x and x <= high_x  (closed, closed)
  select x from t where x >  low_x and x <= high_x  (open,   closed)
  select x from t where x >= low_x and x <  high_x  (closed, open)

  template:
  select x from t where x #low low_x and x #high high_x
  #low  in (">", ">=")
  #high in ("<", "<=")
</pre>
when column x has no associated histogram.
<br>
<br>Letting 
<pre>
  min_x = min (x) over all rows
  max_x = max (x) over all rows
  B = (max_x - min_x) / num_distinct (Band width)
</pre> 
and defining
<pre>
  left band      : min_x     < x < min_x + B
  central region : min_x + B < x < max_x - B
  right band     : max_x - B < x < max_x
</pre>

we have seen that

<ul>
<li> For ranges <b><u>completely</u> contained in one of the two bands</b>
<pre>
     min_x     <= low_x < high_x <= min_x + B
  or max_x - B <= low_x < high_x <= max_x
</pre>
the cardinality can depend on both low_x and high_x, only low_x, only high_x, or none (= constant), depending on the value of #low and #high, in a somewhat counterintuitive way. We have found the relevant formulae.
<li> In <b>all the other cases</b>, a slightly modified (modifications underlined) version of Jonathan Lewis' "standard formula" applies:
<pre>
  cardinality = num_rows * (<u>high_x_effective</u> - <u>low_x_effective</u>) / (max_x - min_x)
              + num_rows * correction_for_or_equal_operators
              <u>- num_rows * correction_for_special_case</u>

  if #low = ">=" <b>and</b> low_x inside the left band then 
    low_x_effective = min_x + B
  else
    low_x_effective = low_x
  end

  if #high = "<=" <b>and</b> high_x inside the right band
    high_x_effective = max_x - B
  else
    high_x_effective = high_x
  end

  correction_for_or_equal_operators = 0
    + 1/num_distinct if #low  = ">="
    + 1/num_distinct if #high = "<="

  correction_for_special_case = 0 
    + 1/num_distinct if low_x  = min_x <b>and</b> #low  = ">"    
    + 1/num_distinct if high_x = max_x <b>and</b> #high = "<"  
</pre>
  This <a href="range_sel_formula_check.sql">fitness test</a> verifies the formula against the CBO, using its <a href="range_sel_formula.sql">pl/sql implementation</a>. 
</ul> 
We have also graphically illustrated, hopefully for a better intuitive understanding, the case of selection over both an infinitesimal and a finite range for the (open,open) and (closed, closed) cases.
<br>
<br>The discussion starts <a href="range_sel_index.html">here</a>.
<br>
<br> And here's my <a href="range_sel_speculation.html">speculation</a> about the rationale behind this strange (but quite sound in hindsight) behaviour.
